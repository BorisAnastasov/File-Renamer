# ðŸ“‚ File Renamer Pro â€” Batch File Rename Tool (C# .NET 8)

**File Renamer Pro** is a lightweight and fast batch file renaming tool built in **C# (.NET 8)**.  
It lets you rename hundreds or thousands of files in seconds using flexible templates, sequence numbers, date tokens, find/replace, and regex.  
By default, it runs in **dry-run mode** to preview changes before making them, and it can generate an **undo log** for safety.
